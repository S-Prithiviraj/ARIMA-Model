This project focuses on forecasting stock prices using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. It involves analyzing historical stock price data to identify trends and 
patterns, implementing the ARIMA model to predict future prices, and evaluating its accuracy using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error 
(RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), achieving a prediction accuracy of 97.5% in upcoming 15-20 observations. The project includes time series decomposition, stationarity testing, log transformation for 
variance stabilization, and automated order selection with Auto ARIMA. Visualizations compare actual vs. predicted stock prices with confidence intervals. The required libraries are 
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, statsmodels, pmdarima, and scikit-learn.
